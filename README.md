Project Description:
Our objective is to create an adventure-like program that will embark users to determine their fate(results) through series of actions and decisions. What they choose to do and how to respond to each situation may determine the outcome. It can be good or bad, it's up to the choices they make as they progress through the game.

Program Details:
The program would likely consist a lot of the If and While statements to operate the various options given to the user in each 'encounter'. Early decisions can affect later decisions and will affect wether certain actions may or may not be addressed.

As of yet this is conceptual, there may be more java type classes and objects being implemented later through the semester. We are planning to add more complicated things if possible to make it a more interesting experience than a simple drive through.
